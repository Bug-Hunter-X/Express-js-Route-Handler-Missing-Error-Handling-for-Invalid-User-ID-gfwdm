# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. The provided code attempts to fetch a user based on their ID, but it fails to handle cases where the ID is not a number or the user does not exist.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed Express.js route handler.  It attempts to find a user by ID, but if the ID is invalid or the user is not found, the server will either throw an error or return an unexpected response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage cases where the user ID is not a number or the user is not found.  This prevents unexpected server crashes and provides appropriate responses to the client.
